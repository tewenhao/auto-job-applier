"""Résumé tailoring: select, reorder, and rewrite the most JD-relevant parts of
the candidate's profile into a one-page structured resume.

The output is a ``TailoredResume`` — structured, template-agnostic. ``latex.py``
renders it into the candidate's LaTeX template. Grounding is strict: only facts
present in the profile, never an invented metric, and ``handling_notes`` are hard
constraints (never surfaced, and they govern which numbers may be stated).
